HTML, short for HyperText Markup Language, is the foundation of the World Wide Web. It's a markup language used to structure web pages and their content. HTML uses elements and tags to define how text, images, and other content should be displayed in a web browser. 
Here's a more detailed explanation:
Markup Language:
HTML is a markup language, meaning it uses tags to mark up content with instructions for browsers. 
Structuring Content:
HTML defines the structure of web pages, including headings, paragraphs, lists, tables, and other elements. 
Displaying Content:
HTML elements tell the browser how to present the content, such as the text, formatting, and layout. 
Creating Hyperlinks:
HTML allows users to create hyperlinks, which are special text or images that, when clicked, take the user to another webpage or document. 
Embedding Media:
HTML can embed various media files, such as images and videos, into web pages. 
Working with Other Technologies:
HTML often works in conjunction with CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) for styling and JavaScript for adding interactivity.
