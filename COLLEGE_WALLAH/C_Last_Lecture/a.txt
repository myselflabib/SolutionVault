The Language Movement (ভাষা আন্দোলন)
Background (পটভূমি):
After the partition of India in 1947, East Pakistan (now Bangladesh) and West Pakistan were united under Pakistan, despite vast cultural and linguistic differences.
Urdu was declared the sole official language of Pakistan in 1948, ignoring Bengali (spoken by 56% of the population).
Causes of the Movement (আন্দোলনের কারণ):
Imposition of Urdu (উর্দুর জবরদস্তি):
West Pakistan’s elite promoted Urdu to "unify" Pakistan, disregarding Bengali.
Cultural Identity (সাংস্কৃতিক পরিচয়):
Bengali was deeply tied to literature, music, and heritage (e.g., works of Rabindranath Tagore).
Economic & Political Marginalization (অর্থনৈতিক ও রাজনৈতিক বৈষম্য):
East Pakistan generated more revenue but received fewer resources.
Power was centralized in West Pakistan.
Educational Rights (শিক্ষার অধিকার):
Urdu’s imposition threatened Bengali-medium education.

Key Events (ঘটনাপ্রবাহ):
1947–1952: Early Protests
Tamuddun Majlish (cultural organization) first demanded Bengali’s recognition.
1948: Dhaka University students protested; Muhammad Ali Jinnah dismissed their demands.
1952: Ekushey February (একুশে ফেব্রুয়ারি)
February 21, 1952: Police fired on peaceful protesters in Dhaka, killing Salam, Rafiq, Barkat, Jabbar, and others.
Symbol: The Shaheed Minar (শহীদ মিনার) was built to honor the martyrs.
1956: Victory
Bengali was finally recognized as an official language of Pakistan.

Impact of the Language Movement (প্রভাব):
Cultural Awakening (সাংস্কৃতিক জাগরণ):
Inspired Bengali literature, music (e.g., songs like "Amar Bhaiyer Rokte Rangano").
Political Mobilization (রাজনৈতিক সংগঠন):
Led to the formation of Awami League (1949) under Sheikh Mujibur Rahman.
1954 United Front Victory (যুক্তফ্রন্টের বিজয়):
A coalition including Awami League won the East Bengal election, demanding autonomy.
Path to 1971 Independence (১৯৭১-এর পথ):
The movement sowed seeds of Bengali nationalism, leading to the Liberation War of 1971.

International Recognition (আন্তর্জাতিক স্বীকৃতি):
UNESCO declared February 21 as International Mother Language Day (1999).
