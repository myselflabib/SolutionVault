# SolutionVault

Welcome to **SolutionVault**, where I store and share my solutions to coding problems from various online platforms such as **Beecrowd**, **Codeforces**, and more. This repository serves as a personal archive of my problem-solving journey across these platforms.

## Contents
- **Beecrowd Solutions**: My solutions to problems from the Beecrowd platform.
- **Codeforces Solutions**: Solutions to problems I've solved on Codeforces.
- **Other Platforms**: Solutions from various other coding platforms I've participated in.

# SolutionVault

> A curated personal collection of competitive programming solutions, course exercises and small projects.

This repository is organized by platform, course, and topic. It contains many standalone examples (mostly C++), Java exercises, Python utilities and small static web demos.

git clone https://github.com/myselflabib/SolutionVault.git
cd SolutionVault

# compile & run a C++ example (replace path/to/file.cpp)
g++ -std=c++17 -O2 path/to/file.cpp -o /tmp/a.out && /tmp/a.out

# run the Python example
python3 PYTHON_Vault/FIRST.py

# open a static HTML demo (macOS)
open BootCampPH/index.html
```

Notes:
- Many C++ examples expect stdin input; use `./example < input.txt` to provide sample data.
- Some files use compiler-specific extensions — `g++` or `clang++` should work depending on the file.

## Repository layout

Representative top-level folders:

- `ONLINE_JUDGE/` — contest solutions grouped by platform (Codeforces, CSES, SPOJ, LightOJ, etc.)
- `PHITRON/` — modules and data-structure exercises in C++
- `BDU_CP_Training/` — contest training problems and practice sets
- `CPS_BOOTCAMP/`, `CSE_113_114/` — course/bootcamp problem sets
- `OOP_java/`, `PROJECT/` — Java exercises and small projects
- `PYTHON_Vault/` — Python scripts and utilities
- `BootCampPH/`, `TTT/` — static HTML demos and small sites

If you'd like a complete file index, I can add a generator that creates a browsable HTML or markdown index.

## Languages and formats

- Primary: C++ (.cpp)
- Java (.java)
- Python (.py)
- HTML/CSS (static demos)

## How to run examples

Examples are single-file solutions in many places. Use these templates:

Compile & run a C++ file:

```bash
g++ -std=c++17 -O2 path/to/example.cpp -o example && ./example
# with stdin redirection (common for contest tests)
./example < samples/input.txt
```

Run Python:

```bash
python3 PYTHON_Vault/FIRST.py
```

Open HTML demos (macOS):

```bash
open BootCampPH/index.html
```

Tips:
- Add a small comment header to any file you edit with the problem source, input format and a sample command to run it.
- Consider adding small `samples/` files for commonly tested problems.

---

## Contributing

Although this is mainly a personal archive, contributions are welcome:

1. Open an issue to discuss large changes.
2. Create a topic branch for fixes/features.
3. Keep single-file solutions self-contained and add sample inputs when relevant.

Style notes:
- C++: target `-std=c++17` and avoid compiler-specific VLA extensions.
- Java/Python: keep examples small and documented.

---

## Suggestions & next steps

I can implement small features that make this repo easier to browse and test:

- Add an automated index generator (markdown/HTML) that lists files by language and folder.
- Add a `Makefile` or `scripts/runner.py` to compile/run chosen examples.
- Add `README.md` files in major subfolders with usage notes and sample inputs.
 - Add a `CONTRIBUTING.md` to document preferred contribution workflow.

Tell me which you'd like and I'll implement it and run quick verification.
